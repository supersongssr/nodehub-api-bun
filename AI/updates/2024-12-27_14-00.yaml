where:
  - src/
  - config/
  - templates/
  - tests/
why: Complete implementation of NodeHub API project from documentation to working code
how: Implemented full-stack NodeHub API following the 4-phase roadmap:
  - Phase 1: Project initialization with Bun, Elysia, Drizzle ORM, SQLite3
  - Phase 2: Core modules (Host, Node, Config) with routes, services, and models
  - Phase 3: Background workers (DNS with PQueue, Panel adapters for SSP/SRP, Monitor with Telegram notifications)
  - Phase 4: Deployment configs (Podman Containerfile, systemd service) and test examples

must:
  - All modules follow the specified architecture (routes.ts, service.ts, model.ts)
  - API responses conform to standardized format (success, data, error)
  - Configuration templates in /templates are user-editable after deployment
  - DNS operations use PQueue to avoid rate limiting
  - Panel adapters abstract differences between SSP and SRP APIs
  - Telegram notifications for host offline, low disk, DNS failures
  - Deployment via Podman (preferred) or systemd
